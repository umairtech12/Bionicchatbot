Clear Space

other elements.

Logo Placement
The logo should be anchored in one of the four corners whenever possible. This allows the system to
be flexible across different formats, while remaining consistent.
This makes the TD Shield the beacon of our brand by decoupling sub-brands, taglines, and the chair,
and providing guidance around clear space and positioning for communications.
This is NOT guidance for web or mobile platforms, although an overarching approach for sub-brands
should be considered.

Relationship of Information Hierarchy to Logo
It’s important to create a clear connection between both elements.
Logo and information hierarchy should be aligned on the same axis (vertical or horizontal) to create a
clear relationship. Logo and sub-brand should not be aligned diagonally on opposite corners. When
placing the information hierarchy on the top right, contact/url and legal copy are excluded.

Centered End-Frame Placement and Size
For the unique case of end frames, the size and placement relationships of the
logo and info hierarchy are enlarged.
The TD Shield is 300% larger at 9 units wide and the base aligns centered on the second gridline
below the horizontal center axis. The info hierarchy is 200% larger at 2 units tall and sits 6 units below
the TD Shield.

In all small-size digital layouts, the TD Shield should be three units tall with two full units of clear
space. For digital or online materials, the minimum size for the TD Shield is 22 pixels in height.
The TD Shield should always be left- or right-aligned to the grid based on which edge of the page is
closer.
